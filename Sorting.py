Hello sir. You are asking about selection sort? Haan, okay okay. Very simple, sir. No tension.

Imagine, we have a line of five school children, okay? All different heights. They are standing all mixed up, random.

My job is to make them stand from shortest to tallest.

So what I will do?

First, I will look at all the five children. I will find the shortest child. Let's say his name is Raju. I will tell him, "Raju, you come here. You stand at the first position."

Okay? Now, the first place is fixed. It is for the shortest boy. Correct?

Now, I will not look at Raju again. His job is done. I will look at the other four children who are still standing randomly.

From these four, again, I will find the shortest child. Let's say her name is Priya. I will tell her, "Priya, you come and stand at the second position, after Raju."

See? Now first two positions are sorted. Shortest, then second-shortest.

Then, three children are remaining. I do the same thing. Find the shortest from the three, and put him in the third place.

I keep doing this again and again. In every step, I select the smallest one from the remaining line and put him in the correct place. Bas. That's it. At the end, the whole line is sorted.

In computer, sir, it is the same thing. We have a list of numbers, like [5, 1, 4, 2].

Computer will look at the whole list. It finds the smallest number. It is 1. It will swap 1 with the first number, 5. Now list is: [1, 5, 4, 2]. First position is sorted.

Now computer forgets about 1. It looks at the rest of the list: [5, 4, 2]. What is smallest? It is 2. It will swap 2 with the number in the second place, 5. Now list is: [1, 2, 4, 5].

Now first two places are sorted. It looks at the rest: [4, 5]. Smallest is 4. But 4 is already in the correct place. So, no problem.

Bas, sir. The list is sorted. It is called 'selection' sort because we are selecting the minimum item every time and putting it in its place.

It is very easy to understand, but for very big lists, it can be a little slow, because it has to check everything, every single time.

That is selection sort, sir.
